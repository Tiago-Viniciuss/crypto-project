                Cryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for secure and private transactions. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized and operate on a technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.
                <br> <br>
                The most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which was created in 2009. Bitcoin introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency that allows individuals to make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Since then, numerous other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins, have been created, each with its own unique features and use cases.
